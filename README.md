## Keyboard setup

Keyboard: [Moonlander Mark I](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/)

I'm currently using the QWERTY setup, but I did move my keycaps around and
give Dvorak a try for a bit. Honestly the learning process made me feel to
slow to work at a speed that allowed me to keep up.

This was cloned from [Comfort Dvorak](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/moonlander/layouts/bgWWV/latest/0) and then modified from there.
